# Enhanced MCQ Generator - Data Structure Documentation

## Overview

The Enhanced MCQ Generator now supports **advanced statement-based questions** with flexible labeling and multiple statement configurations, plus all existing question types. This update enables sophisticated examination papers with various statement formats commonly used in competitive exams and academic assessments.

## Key Enhancements

- **üÜï Enhanced STATEMENTS Structure**: Support for multiple statements with custom labels
- **üîÑ Dual Keyword Support**: Both `"STATEMENT"` and `"STATEMENTS"` keywords work
- **üìù Flexible Labels**: Statement-1/2, Assertion/Reasoning, Assertion/Reasoning/Inference
- **‚¨ÖÔ∏è Backward Compatible**: Existing single statement format still works
- **üéØ Universal Renderer**: Array-based question_text processing for all types

## Supported Question Types

1. **MCQ** - Standard Multiple Choice Questions
2. **S-MCQ** - Statement-based MCQ (Enhanced with multiple statement support)  
3. **MS-MCQ** - Multiple Statement MCQ (List-based)
4. **MTF-MCQ** - Match the Following MCQ
5. **SEQ-MCQ** - Sequencing MCQ  
6. **P-MCQ** - Paragraph-based MCQ

## Question Text Array Format

### New Array Format (Recommended)
```json
"question_text": ["Context/setup text", "Actual question"]
```

### Legacy String Format (Still Supported)
```json
"question_text": "Single question text"
```

The array format allows you to separate:
- **First element**: Contextual setup or introductory text
- **Second element**: The specific question after type-specific content

## Question Type Structures

### 1. Standard MCQ (`mcq`)

```json
{
  "question_type": "mcq",

## Visual Rendering Features

### Enhanced Statement Layout
- Each statement gets its own custom label (e.g., "Statement-1:", "Assertion:", "Reasoning:")  
- Consistent indentation and spacing between multiple statements
- Proper font sizing with labels using smaller bold font (`option_label` size)
- Optimized vertical spacing for compact yet readable layout

### Font Scaling
- Dynamic font sizing based on PDF configuration (small/medium/large)
- Statement labels scale appropriately with overall document size (9pt/10pt/12pt)
- Maintains readability across different paper formats

### Universal Array Processing
- Context/setup text (first array element)
- Keyword-triggered content (STATEMENTS, LIST, MTF_DATA, PARAGRAPH)
- Follow-up question text (subsequent array elements)
- Answer choices with proper spacing

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains **full backward compatibility**:

- **Legacy single statement**: Old `"statement"` field still works alongside new `"statements"` array
- **Dual keyword support**: Both `"STATEMENT"` and `"STATEMENTS"` keywords supported
- **String format**: `"question_text": "Single question"` automatically converted to array
- **Existing JSON files**: Continue to work without modification
- **Question type detection**: Smart detection based on keywords and data fields

## Usage Example

```python
from paper_generators.enhanced_mcq_generator import EnhancedMCQPaperGenerator  
from config.mcq_config import MCQConfig

# Create configuration
config = MCQConfig(
    title="ABC International School",
    subtitle="Class X - Multi-Type MCQ Paper",
    exam_title="Enhanced Statement Questions", 
    paper_format='A4',
    size_config='small'  # small/medium/large
)

# Create generator
generator = EnhancedMCQPaperGenerator(
    config=config,
    show_answers=False
)

# Load and generate from JSON
sections = load_questions_from_json("questions_data/struct2.json")
generator.generate_from_sections(sections, "enhanced_paper.pdf")
```

## Migration Guide

### From Legacy Single Statement:
```json
// Old format
{
  "question_text": ["Context", "Question"],
  "statement": "Single statement text"
}

// New format (backward compatible)
{
  "question_text": ["Context", "STATEMENT", "Question"], 
  "statements": [
    {
      "label": "Statement",
      "text": "Single statement text"
    }
  ]
}
```

### To Enhanced Multiple Statements:
```json
// New enhanced format
{
  "question_text": ["Context", "STATEMENTS", "Question"],
  "statements": [
    {
      "label": "Assertion", 
      "text": "Main claim or hypothesis"
    },
    {
      "label": "Reasoning",
      "text": "Supporting rationale or evidence"  
    }
  ]
}
```

This enhanced structure enables creation of sophisticated examination papers with various statement-based question types commonly used in competitive exams, board examinations, and academic assessments.
