          ],
          "answer": "The westerly jet stream withdraws from the northern plains of India, and the tropical easterly jet stream becomes active over the Indian Peninsula.",
          "reasoning": "During the summer, the subtropical westerly jet stream moves north of the Himalayas. This northward shift allows for the development of the tropical easterly jet stream over peninsular India, which is a key component of the Indian summer monsoon system."

Their energy source is this temperature contrast (baroclinic instability), unlike tropical cyclones which are fueled by warm ocean waters. This allows them to form over land, making Statement II the correct explanation for Statement I."

          "reasoning": "Relative humidity is the ratio of the current amount of water vapor in the air to the maximum amount it can hold at that temperature. As temperature increases (Statement II), the air's capacity to hold water vapor increases. Therefore, if the actual amount of water vapor stays constant, the relative humidity (the ratio) decreases (Statement I). Thus, Statement II is the correct explanation for Statement I."

          "answer": "Heavy sediment deposition due to erosion in the upper Himalayan catchment raises the riverbed, leading to frequent changes in course.",
          "reasoning": "The Kosi river carries a massive sediment load from the Himalayas. As it enters the flat plains of Bihar, its velocity decreases, causing it to deposit this sediment. This raises the riverbed, forcing the river to frequently break its banks and carve out new channels, earning it the name 'Sorrow of Bihar'."

The primary reason for the Black Sea's anoxia (low oxygen) is its strong, permanent stratification (d) caused by freshwater influx, which prevents mixing. The restricted exchange through the Bosphorus Strait (c) exacerbates this. Nutrient runoff (a) worsens surface conditions but the fundamental cause is the lack of deep water circulation."
